Imagine you're ordering a pizza, and you want to make sure the delivery goes smoothly. Here's a comparison:

Placing the Pizza Order:

In Code Terms:
javascript
Copy code
const emptyHeartElement = document.querySelector('.like-glyph');
emptyHeartElement.addEventListener('click', () => {
  // Function to be executed when the user clicks on the empty heart
  function mimicServerCall() {
    // Simulate placing the pizza order (making a server call)
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      const deliveryStatus = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'success' : 'fail';
      if (deliveryStatus === 'success') {
        resolve('Pizza delivered successfully!');
      } else {
        reject('Oops! Pizza delivery failed.');
      }
    });
  }

  // Invoke mimicServerCall and chain .then() and .catch()
  mimicServerCall()
    .then(() => {
      // Code to execute when the pizza (server call) is successful
      console.log('Enjoy your pizza!');
    })
    .catch(() => {
      // Code to execute when there is an issue with the pizza delivery (server call)
      console.error('Pizza delivery failed. Try again later.');
    });
});
Pizza Analogy:
You're clicking the empty heart to order a pizza (place a server call).
The pizza delivery service (server) may either successfully deliver the pizza or encounter an issue.
Chain of Events (Promise Chain):

In Code Terms:
mimicServerCall() returns a promise, representing the pizza delivery process.
.then(() => {}) is like saying, "If the pizza is successfully delivered, do this."
.catch(() => {}) is like saying, "If there's an issue with the pizza delivery, do this instead."
Pizza Analogy:
You're saying, "If the pizza is delivered successfully, enjoy it. If there's an issue, handle it appropriately."
Why Use Promises (Pizza Analogy):

In Code Terms:
Promises help us handle asynchronous operations (like pizza delivery) in a structured way.
Pizza Analogy:
Promises ensure that you know whether your pizza is delivered successfully or not, allowing you to take appropriate actions.
